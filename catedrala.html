            <li>The history of the cathedral is closely linked to the year 1919, when, on 28 July, Banat was united with Romania. </li>
            <br>
            <li>There was an obvious need to build a new place of worship. The necessary land, located at the crossroads of the most important arteries of the city, was donated by the City Hall, and the project of the church was entrusted since 1934 to the architect Ion Trajanescu. </li>
            <br>
            <li> During World War II, after Romania turned its weapons against Germany, German aircraft bombed Timișoara (30–31 October 1944). Six bombs fell on the cathedral, but only one of them exploded, causing significant but limited damage. The interior and exterior painting was finished only in 1956, due to World War II and the difficult period that followed. </li>

            <li>In the basement of the cathedral is the collection of religious art of the Metropolis of Banat. This collection includes objects of ancient religious art from all over Banat. </li>
            <br>
            <li> The collection currently holds over 3,000 rare volumes of church books, over 800 religious icons and paintings and over 130 church objects (precious metal artifacts, clothing and ornaments). There is also a collection of early writings in Romanian. </li>

            <li>The building's style is neo-Moldavian, based on Romanian Orthodox, late Renaissance, Ottoman and Byzantine architecture elements, such as niches under the eaves, ribbed star vaulting in the interior and lacquered discs in a variety of colors. </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The cathedral is 63 metres long and 32 metres wide. It is adorned with 11 spires, the highest being 90.5 metres high.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The seven bells (weighing a total of 8,000 kg) were made from material brought from the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. They were harmonised by composer Sabin Drăgoi. Their sound, with a special resonance, can be heard almost everywhere in Timișoara.
